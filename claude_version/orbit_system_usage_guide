# ORBIT System Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the ORBIT system effectively for knowledge management in Obsidian.

## Core Concepts

The ORBIT system is built around these key principles:

1. **Emergent structure** - Structure grows organically from connections between notes
2. **Every note is born as dust** - New ideas begin unstructured
3. **Hierarchy grows from center outward** - Children can exist before parents
4. **Directional relationships matter** - `orbits` points upstream, `satellites` points downstream
5. **Projects are always folders** - They contain dashboards and associated notes

## Note Types

The ORBIT system uses several note types:

| Type | Description | Stage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `dust` | Default for new thoughts | 0 |
| `source` | External or reference material | - |
| `project` | Dashboard + folder holder | - |
| `original` | Developed original thought | 1 |
| `connector` | Links multiple concepts | 2 |
| `ideal` | Refined, complete concept | 3 |
| `action` | Actionable information | - |

## Directory Structure

The ORBIT system organizes your vault into a hierarchy:

```
Vault/
├── 200-health/                  # Domain folder (fixed)
│   ├── 210-biomechanics/        # Designated project (numbered)
│   │   ├── 0-inbox/             # Project inbox
│   │   ├── 9-source/            # Project sources
│   │   ├── biomechanics.md      # Project dashboard
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── .0-inbox/                # Domain inbox (hidden)
│   │   ├── pelvic-health/       # Floating project
│   │   │   ├── 0-inbox/         # Project inbox
│   │   │   ├── 9-source/        # Project sources
│   │   │   ├── pelvic-health.md # Project dashboard
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── ...
│   └── health.md                # Domain dashboard
├── 300-work/                    # Another domain folder
└── ...
```

## Creating Notes

### Creating a New Thought

1. Create a note in any domain inbox (e.g., `200-health/.0-inbox/`)
2. Add frontmatter with the following:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Glute Bridges
   type: dust
   created: 2025-04-16
   orbits: pelvic health
   ---
   ```
3. The watchdog will:
   - Create a "pelvic health" project if it doesn't exist
   - Move the note to the project's inbox

### Multiple Orbit Relationships

You can make a note orbit multiple projects:

```yaml
orbits: 
  - pelvic health
  - exercise
```

By default, the note will be physically located in the first project's directory, with references in the others.

### Direct Relationship

To specify which project the note should physically reside in:

```yaml
orbits: 
  - pelvic health
  - exercise
